# WP3.4-Link-modules
Links are interfaces developed using chatbot platform at cloud
The purpose of this python program is to establish links through chatbot interfaces between a twinned product model and users, through audio and visual recognition, scripted inputs, sketching, emails, and messages. 
The necessary libraries to execute this algorithm are tensorflow, nltk, and the tensorflow.keras layers library.

write python to execute tensor flow algorithm to establish links thorugh chatbot interfaces between twinned proudct model and users, by  audio and visual  recognition, or thorugh scripted inputs, sketching or e mails, messages?

#Importing necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.regularizers import l2
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

#Loading the data
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

#Reshaping and normalizing the data
X_train = X_train.reshape(X_train.shape[0], 28, 28, 1).astype('float32')/255
X_test = X_test.reshape(X_test.shape[0], 28, 28, 1).astype('float32')/255

#Defining the model
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(


        28, 28, 1), kernel_regularizer=l2(0.001)),
    MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
    ])

#Compiling the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

#Fitting the model
early_stopping_monitor = EarlyStopping(patience=2)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10,
          callbacks=[early_stopping_monitor])

#Evaluating the model
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print('Test accuracy: {}'.format(test_accuracy))

#Creating the chatbot interface
import nltk
from nltk.stem.

def process_input(input_text):
    tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(input_text)
    tokens = [stemmer.stem(word.lower()) for word in tokens]
